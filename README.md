# The Odin Project - Recipes
This is the first little project of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) full-stack web development course.

The purpose of this project is to build a very basic recipes website. Since this is aimed to practice basic HTML structures and concepts, the visuals are going to be quite poor. However, that aspect will be improved in the near future once we're into CSS!
