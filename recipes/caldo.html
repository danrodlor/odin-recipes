            and cold days.

            The <i>caldo</i> is one of the most famous galician dishes of all times. This dish constituted an important
            part of the galician farmer families diet. The bases of the <i>caldo</i> are the vegetables, but the recipe
            usually depended on what the family had available in its pantry. So, during the good times, it often
            included different pieces of meat that had been preserved in salt.

            <li>First things first; <strong>wash your hands</strong>!</li>
            <li>
                Put the white beans in a recipient with cold water with a pinch of salt and let them <strong>soaking
                for at least 12 hours</strong>. You can do this the night before.

            <li>
                Heat a big cooking pot with <strong>5 liters of water</strong>. Add the white beans, the curated pork
                fat, the <i>chorizo</i> and the rest of the meat. Let it cook over <strong>medium heat for an hour
                </strong>. Remove the impurities from time to time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Peel the potatoes and cut them in dices of approximately 3x3 cm. Add them to the pot and let them cook
                for <strong>another 10 minutes</strong>. Once they are cooked, <strong>remove the meat and the
                <i>chorizo</i></strong> from the pot and reserve it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Then, rinse the turnip greens and chop them in big pieces. Add them to the pot and let it cook for
                <strong>20 minutes more</strong>. Check if the broth is salty enough, if it is not, add more
                <strong>salt</strong> but be cautious.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut the meat and the <i>chorizo</i> in smaller pieces and <strong>add it back to the pot</strong>. Stir
                to mix all the ingredients. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>caldo</i> is <strong>ready to taste</strong>! Have in mind that this amount of <i>caldo</i> is
                for several days and that, after the <strong>second day</strong> it will taste even better since all
                the <strong>flavors will be enhanced</strong>!
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p><em>
            If you are willing to take the caldo as a real galician, you can serve it in a cunca (traditional bowl) and
            accompany it with the salty version of the <a href="./filloas.html">filloas</a>!
