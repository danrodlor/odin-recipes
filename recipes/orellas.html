            <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>
                <i>Orellas</i> is a <b>traditional galician dish</b>. <i>Orellas</i> is a galician word that basically
                means ears. It is typically prepared during carnival time and Lent.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you may have suspected, this dish is called <i>orellas</i> because it resembles a mountain of cooked pig
                ears. This is not a coincidence, the fact this dish is traditionally prepared during carnival time and Lent
                serves two purposes: to take advantage of the last days before the Lent fast, and to mimic a good ration of
                pig ears to trick the brain without breaking the Lent meat consumption restrictions.

            <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol class="no-margin big-item-separation">
                <li>First things first; <strong>wash your hands</strong>!</li>
                <li>
                    Put the water in a big bowl and add the melted lard, the zest, the sugar, the sweet anise liqueur, the
                    eggs and the salt. Mix it well until it becomes <strong>homogeneous</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the flour <strong>little by little</strong> at the same time you stir the mixture to avoid lumps.
                    Once it takes some consistency, leave the rods aside and <strong>use your hands</strong>. Beat it until
                    you get a greasy and <strong>nice dough</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Let the dough rest for <strong>at least for an hour</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now it is time to extend the dough and give it shape! Take small portions of the dough (approximately
                    of the size of a walnut) and work them out with the help of a rolling pin. Remember, you have to make
                    the <i>orellas</i> <strong>as thin as you can</strong>. Once they have the desired thickness, fold one
                    side to give them the <strong>shape of a pig ear</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Put a deep frying pan or a small saucepan with a <strong>generous amount of sunflower oil</strong> at
                    medium heat. Throw in a small dough ball. This ball will act as a tester, once it turns golden, it is 
                    time to start frying our <i>orellas</i>, side by side.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove them from the pan and let them rest on <strong>absorbent paper</strong> to avoid excess oil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once all the <i>orellas</i> are ready, sprinkle a mix of powdered <strong>sugar and cinnamon</strong>
                    over them!
                </li>
            </ol>
